Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) Feed Fixer
===

Unfortunately, NASA and the University of Michigan are far too busy teaching
students and exploring the universe to fix their RSS feed, which leaves fans or
users of the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD for short) with a sub-par RSS
experience.

As a fix for this, I've created this small collection of python scripts to
gently re-shape their RSS data into something more stable and well escaped.
